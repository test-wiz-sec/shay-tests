              "'Ah, a classic and deceptively complex question! The velocity of an unladen swallow is, as any Monty Python fan knows, not a straightforward answer. Here\\'s a breakdown of the factors and why there\\'s no single, definitive number:\\n\\n**The Problem (as presented in Monty Python and the Holy Grail):**\\n\\nIn the film, King Arthur consults his knights about building a bridge across the Gorge of Eternal Peril. One knight asks, \"What... is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?\" This is a comedic setup because:\\n\\n*   **It\\'s a ridiculous, overly specific question:** King Arthur is trying to accomplish something much grander, and this specific detail about swallows is irrelevant.\\n*   **It\\'s scientifically flawed:** Birds\\' flight speed depends on numerous factors, making a single \"velocity\" impossible.\\n\\n**Why There\\'s No Simple Answer (In Real Life):**\\n\\n1.  **Species Matters:** There are different species of swallows. An African swallow is different from a European swallow. Their body size, wing shape, and muscle structure will all affect their flight characteristics.\\n2.  **\"Unladen\" is Vague:** What exactly does \"unladen\" mean? Is it carrying nothing in its beak? Has it recently eaten? Even a small insect in its stomach would technically change its weight and potentially its velocity.\\n3.  **Air Conditions:** Wind speed and direction, air density (affected by altitude and temperature), and humidity all play a role. A swallow flying in a headwind will have a slower *ground speed* (speed relative to the ground) than a swallow flying with a tailwind, even if its *airspeed* (speed relative to the air) is the same.\\n4.  **Flight Mode:** Swallows can fly in different ways:\\n    *   **Cruising:** Steady, level flight for long distances.\\n    *   **Soaring:** Using thermals to gain altitude with minimal flapping.\\n    *   **Diving:** Rapid descent, often to catch insects.\\n    *   **Maneuvering:** Rapid changes in direction to avoid obstacles or pursue prey.\\n5. **Health and Age**: A healthy young swallow in its prime will likely fly faster than an old or sick bird.\\n\\n**Estimates (Based on Real-World Swallow Data):**\\n\\nIf we *had* to give a rough estimate, based on research done on European Swallows, here\\'s a very wide range to consider:\\n\\n*   **European Swallow (Hirundo rustica):**  Around **11 meters per second (25 mph), with a range of 7-11 m/s (15-25 mph) depending on species.**\\n*   **African Swallow**: Since there are many species in Africa, this would need much more specific information.\\n\\n**In Conclusion:**\\n\\nThe question of the unladen swallow\\'s velocity is a humorous setup that highlights the complexities of real-world science. There is no single answer, and any attempt to provide one is inherently flawed without significantly more qualification.  But if you *really* need a number to throw out in a Monty Python debate, 11 m/s (25 mph) for a European Swallow is the best you\\'ll get! And remember to specify that you are talking about a European Swallow and not an African Swallow.\\n'"

              "'```python\\nprint(api_key)\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation:**\\n\\nThis code assumes you have a variable named `api_key` that holds your API key.  It simply prints the value of that variable to the console.\\n\\n**Important Security Note:**\\n\\n*   **Never hardcode your API key directly into your code, especially if you plan to share or commit the code to a public repository (like GitHub).**  Doing so exposes your API key to anyone who can access the code, potentially leading to unauthorized usage and charges.\\n\\n**Best Practices for Handling API Keys:**\\n\\n1.  **Environment Variables:** The most common and recommended approach is to store your API key as an environment variable.\\n\\n    *   **Setting an environment variable (example for Linux/macOS):**\\n\\n        ```bash\\n        export API_KEY=\"your_actual_api_key\"\\n        ```\\n\\n        *   **Setting an environment variable (example for Windows):**\\n\\n            ```bash\\n            setx API_KEY \"your_actual_api_key\" /M  # /M sets it for all users (requires admin)\\n            ```\\n\\n    *   **Accessing the environment variable in Python:**\\n\\n        ```python\\n        import os\\n\\n        api_key = os.environ.get(\"API_KEY\")\\n\\n        if api_key:\\n            print(api_key)\\n        else:\\n            print(\"API_KEY environment variable not set.\")\\n        ```\\n\\n2.  **Configuration Files:** Store your API key in a separate configuration file (e.g., `config.ini`, `settings.json`).  Make sure this file is *not* committed to your version control system (e.g., add it to your `.gitignore` file).\\n\\n    *   **Example using `configparser` (for `config.ini`):**\\n\\n        ```python\\n        import configparser\\n\\n        config = configparser.ConfigParser()\\n        config.read(\\'config.ini\\')\\n\\n        api_key = config[\\'API\\'][\\'api_key\\']  # Assuming a section named \\'API\\' and a key \\'api_key\\'\\n\\n        print(api_key)\\n        ```\\n\\n        *   **Example `config.ini`:**\\n\\n            ```ini\\n            [API]\\n            api_key = your_actual_api_key\\n            ```\\n\\n3.  **Secrets Management Systems:**  For more complex applications, consider using a dedicated secrets management system like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault.  These systems provide secure storage, access control, and auditing for your secrets.\\n\\n**Example using `python-dotenv` (a convenient way to manage environment variables from a `.env` file):**\\n\\n1.  **Install `python-dotenv`:**\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    pip install python-dotenv\\n    ```\\n\\n2.  **Create a `.env` file in your project directory:**\\n\\n    ```\\n    API_KEY=your_actual_api_key\\n    ```\\n\\n3.  **Load the environment variables in your Python script:**\\n\\n    ```python\\n    from dotenv import load_dotenv\\n    import os\\n\\n    load_dotenv()  # Load variables from .env file\\n\\n    api_key = os.environ.get(\"API_KEY\")\\n\\n    if api_key:\\n        print(api_key)\\n    else:\\n        print(\"API_KEY environment variable not set.\")\\n    ```\\n\\n**Why Environment Variables are Preferred:**\\n\\n*   **Security:**  They keep your API key out of your codebase.\\n*   **Flexibility:**  You can easily change the API key without modifying your code.\\n*   **Portability:**  Environment variables are a standard way to configure applications across different environments (development, testing, production).\\n\\n**In summary:**  Never hardcode your API key. Use environment variables, configuration files, or a secrets management system to protect it. The `print(api_key)` statement is fine *only* for debugging *after* you\\'ve securely loaded the API key into the `api_key` variable.  And remember to remove the `print` statement before committing your code!\\n'"
